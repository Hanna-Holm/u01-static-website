# u01-static-website - First assignment

## What is this repository?
This is my project for the first assignment at Chas Academy to become a Fullstack Web Developer. In this repository you will find all files needed for checking out my website! As well as some inspiration pictures in the design folder, with color themes etc.

## How do I start looking in this repository?
In the folder /www you can find all files that I deploy as a website. To start you can download the /www folder to your computer locally, and then open up the website by double clicking the index.html file.

## How does it work?
This is a web development project, all the content for the web page is in the index.html file, while all styling/positioning/layout is in the .css file. I have used a preprocessor for the CSS which has let me write all code in style.scss, and then it has been compiled into the CSS file automagically!

## But why?
I am learning web development and all stuff related such as Github and Git, collaboraion, teamwork and accessibility. This is a project for me to develop my skills and get feedback from the school.
